# tilos

my very own puzzle solver.

## what can it do?

currently nothing, i just created the repository.

## history

i finally got to play "the talos principle", which i bought many years back. i do eventually give up on some of the puzzles when my brain can't think. but so far, the little tetris-like puzzle were not posing a challenge. until one did. and here we are!

i could not be bothered to think of a solution, so i decided to program it instead. as you do.

the name comes from the pieces ("sigils") which are available to you to solve the little puzzles. a t-shape, i-shape, l-shape, o-shape (squares are close enough to circles, right?), and s-shape (you could argue it's more of a "z", but who cares). tilos.

when i realized the game was called "talos", the pieces for naming my little helper "tilos" just kind of fell into place (see what i did there?).

## license

listen, i am not a lawyer. but i like rust and rust's decision to dual-license stuff under mit and apache is fine by me. so the files in this project are dual-licensed under those terms, too.
